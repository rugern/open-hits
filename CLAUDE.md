# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

Open-source clone of the board game **Hitster**. Players hear a song, then guess one of five things — selected by a spinning wheel:

1. Artist
2. Song title
3. Exact release year
4. Release year ±3 years
5. Decade of release

The app plays music via the user's Spotify account (from a playlist they choose) and keeps song metadata hidden until players choose to reveal it.

## Stack & deployment

- TypeScript + React + Tailwind CSS
- Built to static files via GitHub Actions, hosted on GitHub Pages
- **No backend** — everything runs in the browser

## Architectural constraints worth knowing

**Spotify auth must be PKCE (Authorization Code with PKCE flow).** Implicit Grant is deprecated, and Client Credentials can't access user playlists. Since there is no backend, the client secret cannot be used — PKCE is the only viable flow. The redirect URI must be the GitHub Pages URL.

**Playback model.** Two paths exist; pick deliberately:
- **Web Playback SDK** — plays audio in the browser tab itself. Requires Spotify Premium. Gives precise control and is the cleanest fit for "hide metadata while audio plays."
- **Connect API** (`/me/player/play`) — controls an existing Spotify app on the user's device. Works with Free accounts (in theory; `/play` still requires Premium in practice), but the Spotify app/device shows song info, defeating the hide-metadata requirement.

**Active choice: Connect API.** This project chose the Connect API path for device flexibility — players can use their phone, desktop app, or smart speaker as the audio output. The trade-off is that the *receiving device's* Spotify UI displays the title/artist/album art, so players need to keep that screen out of sight during play. The web app itself still hides metadata until reveal. This is the deviation flagged below in "Hiding metadata".

**Hiding metadata.** Track payloads from `/v1/playlists/{id}/items` contain artist/title/album. The web UI must withhold these until the players trigger reveal. Treat the track list as a controlled secret in app state — do not log it, do not render it anywhere except the reveal card, and be careful with React DevTools-friendly prop drilling. Note the Connect API caveat above: the *receiving Spotify device's screen* will show this info regardless — that's an accepted trade-off, not a bug.

**Premium gating happens at click-time.** `/v1/me/player/play` requires a Premium account, but we deliberately do **not** request the `user-read-private` scope (which would expose `product` on `/me` and let us detect Premium upfront). Instead, Free users discover the limitation when the play call returns 403 with `reason: PREMIUM_REQUIRED`, and `PlayingView` renders an inline amber banner explaining what's needed. This is a scope-minimization tradeoff, not an oversight.

**Release year.** Spotify's track object exposes `album.release_date` and `album.release_date_precision` (`year` | `month` | `day`). Year-precision is enough for all five question types, but the precision field must be checked — some albums only have year, which still works; the failure mode is missing data, not wrong data.

**GitHub Pages base path.** If deployed at `username.github.io/open-hits/`, the build needs a non-root base path (Vite `base`, React Router `basename`). The OAuth redirect URI must match exactly.

**Local dev: 127.0.0.1, not localhost.** Spotify rejects `localhost` redirect URIs for apps registered after early 2025. `vite.config.ts` sets `server.host: '127.0.0.1'` so the dev server binds to the IPv4 loopback. Visit `http://127.0.0.1:5173/open-hits/` — `localhost:5173` will time out by design, since the dev server isn't bound there.

**Category color is the visual reminder.** Each of the 5 wheel categories has a distinctive hex color in `WHEEL_CATEGORIES` (`src/game/wheel.ts`). Reuse that color anywhere the player needs to be reminded of the current category — already done on the wheel segments, the `PlayingView` heading + button, the `RevealingView` category pill + button, and the bingo cells. When adding new UI that references a category, pull the color from `WHEEL_CATEGORIES.find(c => c.id === id).color` rather than re-picking; consistency is the whole point.

**Routing.** React Router v7 (`react-router-dom`) with `<BrowserRouter basename={import.meta.env.BASE_URL}>`. Two routes: `/` (host flow — landing/playlist/game) and `/join` (player flow — bingo card, no Spotify auth required). Direct loads of `/join` on GitHub Pages would 404; `public/404.html` plus a decoder in `index.html` form the standard SPA fallback (rafgraph/spa-github-pages pattern), so deep links and refreshes work.

**Spotify app status: Development Mode.** The registered app hasn't been submitted for Extended Quota Mode review, which carries two practical consequences:
- **Spotify-curated playlists 403** on the tracks endpoint. Anything where `owner.id === 'spotify'` (Discover Weekly, editorial like "Today's Top Hits") is unreadable. We filter these out of the playlist grid in `App.tsx`.
- **Third-party playlists are an inconsistent signal.** A user can read playlists they've collaborated on, but the API's `collaborative` flag isn't reliably set for newer share-via-link / add-user flows. There's no field on the simplified playlist object that says "you can read this". We show all non-curated playlists optimistically and let `fetchPlaylistTracks` surface a friendly amber error in `GameView` when one 403s — see the `tracks_fetch_403` branch of the error UI.

To lift either, the app needs to be approved for Extended Quota Mode via the Spotify dev dashboard.

## Status

Fully scaffolded, deployed at https://rugern.github.io/open-hits/, and the entire game loop works end-to-end: sign in (PKCE) → playlist grid (with filter input and Spotify-curated hidden) → click a playlist → ready screen with device picker → spin wheel (5–11s, click-to-trigger, optional carnival "Bop it" mode) → track plays in background → reveal album art + title + artists + year (color-coded to the category) → continue → game over with re-shuffle / pick-another. The screen wake lock is held while a game is active. There is also a player-side `/join` route with a 5×5 bingo card (color-only cells, balanced 5-each) and a guess input that goes full-screen on landscape orientation for a "show your phone" reveal. Outstanding ideas live in `TODO.md`.
